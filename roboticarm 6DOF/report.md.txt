  Arduino Uno microcontroller board, serving as the central processing unit for servo control and signal interpretation.

- **Rotary Encoder:**  
  A KY-040 incremental rotary encoder connected to digital pins (D2, D3, D4) for angular position adjustment and speed control.

- **Input Interface:**  
  Three push buttons for servo selection — one for next servo, one for previous servo, and one for toggling the angle adjustment mode.

- **Actuators:**  
  Six SG90 micro servo motors, each representing a degree of freedom (DOF) in the robotic arm: base, shoulder, elbow, wrist pitch, wrist roll, and gripper.

- Smooth and accurate switching was observed between all six servos.

### 3. Encoder Control Test
- The encoder’s clockwise and counterclockwise rotations were tested for consistent pulse detection.  
- Each detent change corresponded precisely to one servo angle increment or decrement.

### 4. Speed Reset Test
- The encoder push button successfully reset the movement speed variable to the default 5° step.  
- No servo position was reset during this operation.

### 5. Load Stability Test
