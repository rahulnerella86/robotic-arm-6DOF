# robotic-arm-6DOF
Arduino-based 6DOF robotic arm using a rotary encoder to control servo motor angles. Three buttons are used: one to switch to the next servo, one to switch to the previous, and one to adjust the servo angle. The rotary encoder button resets the servo angle to one, enabling precise, user-controlled movement and accurate servo positioning.
