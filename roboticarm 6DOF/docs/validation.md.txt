# Validation and Testing Report

## Tests Conducted

### 1. Servo Angle Accuracy Test
- Servo angles were adjusted in increments of 5° using the encoder.
- Achieved consistent response within ±2° tolerance.

### 2. Servo Switching Test
- Servo selection buttons were tested for response.
- Smooth and reliable switching between all six servos.

### 3. Encoder Control Test
- Encoder rotation direction and pulse detection verified.
- System accurately increased or decreased servo angles per step.

### 4. Speed Reset Test
- Encoder push button successfully reset step size to default 5°.
- Servo positions remained unchanged after reset.

### 5. Load Test
- Arm operated continuously for 30 minutes.
- No overheating or erratic servo motion observed.

### 6. Power Test
- Verified operation with 5V, 2A supply.
- Stable voltage maintained across all servo operations.
